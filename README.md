### Hello! :)

My name is Nimisha 🌼

I am a UX designer currently working at Nextcloud. I think the Internet is an interesting place with interesting people, and I’m excited about building products that help make it safer, kinder, and more open. 

Here are some things I’m doing now:

☁️ Designing an open source file sharing and collaboration platform at [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

🌻 Helping people transform their ideas into prototypes with the help of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/) and [Superbloom](https://simplysecure.org/)

🖌️ Advocating for better design in open source software at [Open Source Design](https://opensourcedesign.net/)
